This repository contains scripts to install and upgrade Atlassian products on
AWS. They also apply some minor tweaks to some of the configuration files.

The "install.sh" scripts can be used in the UserData section of an EC2 resource
in Cloudformation templates.

The "upgrade.sh" scripts can be run on an existing EC2 by extracting the branch
.zip in the /tmp folder of the EC2, and running it with the proper arguments.

Each product has its own branch, where more details can be found.
